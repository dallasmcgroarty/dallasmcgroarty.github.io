            <div class='p-2' style='color: black; font-size: 20px;'>Hello! My name is Dallas McGroarty and I recently graduated with my Bachelor's in Science in Computer Science 
                from California State University, Fullerton. Currently looking for a entry level positon in a tech-related field. At the moment I am really into web development, 
                but software development, systems administration, IT, and other fields also interest me. I am a hard-working team player with a passion for helping others succeed. 
                Always hungry to learn and become a better programmer as well as human being. Using my communication skills, creativity, and coding ability I hope to be a part of something that truly benefits people.    </div>
          </div>

        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-self-center" id="about-box" style="flex-direction: column; background-color: white; width: 100%; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 20px;">
            <div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-center" style="padding-top: 20px; width: 100%">
                <div class='p-2' style='color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;'>Skills and Abilities</div>
            </div>
            <p class="text-center" id="sub-title">Web Development</p>
            <div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-center" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <div class='p-2' style='color: black; font-size: 20px;'>Recently I have been focusing on my web development skills. This includes HTML, 
                CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. I have created and developed an Angular 7 project and also incorporated Firebase. So, I am familiar 
                with TypeScript and the Angular development environment. Been meaning to learn ReactJS as well. 
                At the moment I am currently more interested in being a web developer either front-end, back-end or both. Full-stack developer sounds interesting too.
                But, I am interested in all fields of tech and computer science and would love to learn anything new and useful.<br> </br>
                <p class="text-center" id="sub-title">Coding / Software Development</p>
                In terms of coding and software development I have a good foundation since I took a lot of good, tough courses and received my Bachelor's
                in Computer Science. This included math, programming courses, algorithm engineering, database systems, computer organization, data science, 
                operating systems, computer communication, and so on. I do all of my coding with Visual Studio Code and mainly use Windows, but I have a Linux dual boot and have been using 
                Linux for the past 3 years for software development and system administration. Linux just works better sometimes, lol. I originally learned to 
                code using C++, but since then I have learned to use Python, PHP, SQL, C, R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.<br></br>
                <p class="text-center" id="sub-title">Databases</p>
                I have had a good amount of database experience through classes, projects and self-learning. I have primarily used MySQL for most of my database 
                needs and with that SQL. I have a great understanding of relational database systems and database design. I have used MongoDB before as well, but I 
                am not as familiar with it. I have also used Firebase's Cloud Firestore when working on my Angular 7 project. I am looking to use it more often, since it is 
                free up to a certain amount of data, and can be used in live web applications.

        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-self-center" id="about-box" style="flex-direction: column; background-color: white; width: 100%; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 20px;">
            <div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-center" style="padding-top: 20px; width: 100%">
                <div class='p-2' style='color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;'>Interests</div>
            </div>
            <div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-center" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <div class='p-2' style='color: black; font-size: 20px;'>When I'm not working on some project or learning more about coding and computer science, I'm just a 
                regular dude. I go to the gym frequently to stay in shape and see friends. I love to play sports such as Soccer, Basketball, Golf, Tennis, Bowling, 
                Pool, Disc Golf, etc.. Really just name a sport and I'd be down to play. I'm super into movies and shows and I try to go to the theatres atleast once 
                every two weeks. Fashion is another interest of mine, I've always been drawn to different styles and ways to change your appearance. I couldn't 
                live without music to be honest, it's one of the greatest creations of all time. I'm also an avid gamer, and am always looking for new and exciting 
                games to play on the PC or PS4 with my friends. But, my real love is technology, and the great things it has and can accomplish. The benefits it brings 
                to human life is abundant and growing. I want to be apart of something big, something that truly benefits people, and somewhere I can use my skills and abilities 
                to bring it to life.
